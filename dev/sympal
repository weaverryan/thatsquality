 - make the slots be a specific widget / renderer
 - need an object rendering type - a really easy choosing widget of some sort (think chooser)
 - edit one slot at a time
 - shouldn't be able to create content types
 - can't choose template for content type when creating a new one
 - why even be able to choose things like template & module/action for
   content type - that all requires hard-coding anyways to get it all setup
   -> is there a better way to get the db values setup to reflect the
      new code tools you've created in code
   -> really belongs in a migration, or an upgrade script
 - places in the system for giving very descriptive education (like when
   you add a new repo on git)
