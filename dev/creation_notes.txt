 - do the install script
 - replace everything with externals
 - create theme plugin
 - set the default_theme: key in my app's app.yml
 - added in my analytics code
 - copied pages install and removed most of it, added the basic nav
 - start setting up a few layout content slots, put them in the fixtures
 - start filling in pages, I added the blog plugin
 - put more logic into my post install to pimp out the blog fixtures
   - took the list (index) and gave it a custom_path
   - set the page_title
   - hooking up a few of the app.yml configurations
 - pimping out the breadcrumbs
 - weird that when I created a blog post, it didn't automatically live
    with a menu item under blog. I had to create this, else the breadcrumbs
    wouldn't show up at all.
 - the breadcrumbs are a bit hard to style. But, this works:
      #sympal_breadcrumbs li:before {
        content: "\00BB \0020";
      }
 - pimped out styling on page header
 -> layout slots still need more work
 - added comments plugin (wow, it added right to my blog automatically!)
 - hacking the slots to just grab some random slot if there isn't one (think comments page)
 - adding the tags plugin
  - after some mods I made, this should be hella-smooth
  - it auto-enables itself for blog at the very least
  - will show up on the blog sidebar
  - pimped out the sidebar to be configurable
 - changed the default_path for the blog content type
 - added an "tqApps" model
 - added fixtures for the tqApps content list page and menu item
 - created an old-fashion component/template for this
   - brought in the breadcrumbs
   - pointed at a template
   - added some fixtures, a Page type content
